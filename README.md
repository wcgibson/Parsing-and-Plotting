Parsing-and-Plotting
====================

I'm trying to create a series of graphs that plot data that monitors the performance of a weather radar

I've only been working with Python for a couple of weeks, so apologies for not having the most efficient code.

That being said, I would greatly appreciate any help with plotting the PS0Ambient Temp and PS1Ambient Temp graph.
I need to have dates pulled from files in a user defined directory be the major ticks.  I also need the minor ticks
to be the hours of the day that go from 0 - 23.  All of that I have done, for that one particular graph - and for now
that one graph is all that I'm interested in.  

My issue now, is that when I zoom or pan, the ticks do not update.  

Thanks,

Chris
